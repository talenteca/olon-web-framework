/** Mix this trait in to get some low-cost implicits for logging boxes easily.
  * The consumer will need to implement a `[[logBoxError]]` method to log
  * messages with an optional `Throwable`, as well as its related friends for
  * trace, debug, info, and warn levels. This allows abstracting out where and
  * what the actual logger is.
  *
  * With this mixed in, boxes will have `logFailure` methods. The first logs all
  * `[[Failure]]`s as well as `[[Empty]]`. The second logs only `Failure`s and
  * `[[ParamFailure]]`s, treating `Empty` as a valid value. These both log their
  * respective items at ERROR level. You can also use `traceLog*`, `debugLog*`,
  * `infoLog*`, and `warnLog*` if you want to log at other levels (e.g., you can
  * use `infoLogFailure` to log an `Empty` or `Failure` at `INFO` level).
  *
  * All of these return the box unchanged, so you can continue to use it in
  * `for` comprehensions, call `openOr` on it, etc.
  *
  * There is an implementation for anyone who wants to use Lift's `[[Loggable]]`
  * trait called `[[LoggableBoxLogging]]`. Another implementaiton is available
  * for use with a plain SLF4J logger, `SLF4JBoxLogging`. You can also implement
  * a version for any other logging adapter. Lastly, you can simply import
  * `BoxLogging._` to get the methods available at a top level; however, note
  * that using them this way will lose information about where the log message
  * came from.
  *
  * Here is an example of how you might use this in system that executes a
  * third- party service and notifies another system of failures.
  *
  * {{{
  * val systemResult: Box[ServiceReturn] =
  *   system
  *     .executeService(true, requester)
  *     .map(...)
  *     .logFailure("Failed to execute service") match {
  *       case Full(content) =>
  *         content
  *       case failure: Failure =>
  *         otherSystem.notifyFailure(failure)
  *       case Empty =>
  *         otherSystem.notifyFailure(Failure("No idea what happened."))
  *     }
  * }}}
